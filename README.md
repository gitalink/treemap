# NYC Treemap

## About the project

This is my Grace Hopper Stackathon project. I had 2 days to work on anything my heart desire. I knew I wanted to explore
react-native and that I wanted to work with data. While browsing NYC open data portal (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), 
I came accross the 2015 NYC Tree Census dataset (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cityofnewyork.us/5rq2-4hqu)
and immediately knew that I want to visualize it. Who would not want to see all trees on their block and their names.

## The App

NYC Treemap is a mobile app for New Yorkers who are curious to know more about the trees in their neighborhood. The app detects 
users location, opens up a map centering around that location and displays all the trees within 1 mile radius as markers. 
By hovering on the marker, users can see metadata about the tree, such as common name and latin name.
